## Changing an account's organization number

Please note that you cannot readily change your organization number (for business accounts) or your personal number (for individual accounts) in the {{gui}}.

In case you do wish to change any of those, you will have to submit a [{{legal_docs.transfer_form.name}}]({{legal_docs.transfer_form.url}}) via our [{{support}}](https://{{support_domain}}/servicedesk).

## E-invoicing

This is available to select accounts.
More specifically, you have the option of e-invoicing if all three conditions are met:

* the country in the customer contract is set to _Sweden_ (that is the country in the account owner data, not the country in the billing data),
* you have provided a company name,
* you have provided a Swedish [_organisationsnummer_](https://www.bolagsverket.se/foretag/organisationsnummer.1207.html) (link in Swedish).

If you are eligible for e-invoicing and wish to activate it, in the _Account settings_ vertical pane go to the _Invoice settings_ section and click the _Request form_ link.
